# U-Net Implementation in PyTorch

This project is an implementation of the U-Net architecture using PyTorch. https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597
U-Net is a convolutional network designed for fast and precise segmentation of images.

## Features

- Full U-Net architecture implemented from scratch.
- Customizable network parameters.
- Supports various image segmentation tasks.

## CropDataset
This project has been implemented due to a personal need to segment the crop parts using a custom dataset. In order to run it with any other dataset one needs to modify the the content of dataset folder. However, for learning purposes I think it is a neat and readable implementation which I think is mostly correct.
